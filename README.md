<h3>🧠 AI & Machine Learning</h3>
<p>
🌐 I have Hands-on experience with AI/ML frameworks and methodologies
</p>
<p>
I have worked using Python for automation. I used different ML models, where tools like pandas, Matplotlib, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Pipenv, and Numpy. Techniques such as normalization, standardization, and handling missing data are fundamental.  
Also, I worked on some libraries such as scikit-learn, NLP, NLTK, and some others libraries and implemented sentiment analysis on different sites like AWS and Daraz for products.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I mentored training models for extracting some info from clients' emails for our big data where I led and managed entirely this project <a href="https://fulfillment.global" target="_blank">https://fulfillment.glob</a>. That project was developed in Ruby on Rails, but I also created documentation for our various partners.
